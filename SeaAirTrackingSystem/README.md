# Realtime visual tracking of Sea/Air traffic data

all data are dummy, or randomly generated including port names


 * You can control generation rate and speed for ships/airplanes using top left seek bars
 * You can view information about each port, including:
 <br> - Port capacity ( max trips)
 <br> - Count of incoming/outgoing trips
 <br> - list of trips
 
 * All ports, ships, and planes are clickable
 
no proper documentation will be added soon
<br>yet, a picture worth a thousand words
